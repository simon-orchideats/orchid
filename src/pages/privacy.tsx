        </Typography>
        <br />
        <Typography variant='body1'>
          Table, or third parties engaged by us, may use web beacons on some pages of this site. A web beacon (also known as a pixel tag or clear GIF) is a graphic image which is used to better understand the browsing patterns of visitors to the page.
          <br />
          <br />
          When the HTML code for the web beacon points to a site to retrieve the pixel image, information can be passed along, such as the IP address of the computer that requested the image, the time the web beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that was used, and previously set cookie values. Web beacons DO NOT pass or read personally identifiable information about you.
          <br />
          <br />
          Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies set by trusted third parties that are used to assess the effectiveness of particular promotional campaigns or to optimize advertising once a user leaves a website. View your browser’s help section to determine how to configure your browser to reject or manage first party (i.e., Table) and/or third-party cookies. Table shares aggregated information collected through web beacons to vendors for which the beacon was set to determine the success of marketing campaigns, but does not disclose personally identifying information to these vendors.

          HOW DOES TABLE PROTECT CUSTOMER INFORMATION?
          <br />
          <br />
          Protecting your information from unauthorized disclosure is extremely important to us. We use the industry standard technology to protect the security of your information. We have taken certain physical, electronic, contractual and managerial steps designed to safeguard the information we collect from you. Unfortunately, no data transaction over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The Site operator is not subject to the privacy and data security requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”).
          <br />
          <br />
          WILL TABLE DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS TO OUTSIDE PARTIES?
          <br />
          <br />
          Table shares information with third-party intermediaries for shipping and billing purposes and with other third-party intermediaries that provide a service for Table to help us operate our business, our Site, or administer activities on our behalf. These companies do not retain personal information or share it with any other parties. These companies may include Cybersource, United Parcel Service, Federal Express, Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express and others.
          <br />
          <br />
          Table may also provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors.
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition, from time to time, we may make customer e-mail addresses and postal addresses available to other reputable business associates whose products or services might be of value to you. If you do not want us to share your information with other companies or organizations, please let us know by emailing us at simon@tableweekly.com. If you opt-out of promotional or newsletter emails from Table, we may continue to send you certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages, relating to Table that are necessary to our relationship with you.
          <br />
          <br />
          Table may also disclose your personal information to third parties in certain limited circumstances, as follows (1) as necessary if we believe that there has been a violation of our Terms and Conditions, of the law, of our rights or of any third party; (2) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law; and (3) if you have given permission for us to share your account information with other members of your household.
          <br />
          <br />
          Table may also sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personally identifiable information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity’s planned processing of your information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.

          OUR BULLETIN BOARDS, SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES, CHAT ROOMS & USER BLOGS
          <br />
          <br />
          Our program provides support through bulletin boards, chat rooms (support groups), social media pages and blogs. This format gives our members the opportunity to interact with each other. These areas are moderated to help keep inappropriate messages from being posted. You are offered the opportunity to include your e-mail address with your message, but you are not obligated to do so. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online (whether it is on message boards, through e-mail, in meeting rooms, on social media pages or in blogs) your information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. We cannot control the actions of any third parties. We reserve the irrevocable, perpetual and worldwide right to copy and post both within the Table website, and those of its parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, assigns, agents and licensees and any social media outlets and advertising medium through which we are engaged any comments, pictures or other information you post on the bulletin boards, social media pages, chat rooms, blogs, or elsewhere on the Table community website, without any further notice to you or any remuneration therefore.

          NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS – YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

        <br />
        <Typography variant='body1'>
          California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses’ practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. As discussed above, if you wish to opt-out of our sharing of your information with third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes or to find out more about your opt-out rights, please contact us at simon@tableweekly.com.
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition, pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.110 and 1798.115, you have the right to request once every 12 months, free of charge, the disclosure of the categories of personal information collected by us, the categories of sources from which your personal information is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling such information, the categories of third parties with whom we share your information, the specific information we have collected about you, and the personal information that was sold, if any, to third parties in the preceding 12 months. If you want to review, verify or correct your personal information, please contact us as discussed below. However, please note, there are instances where applicable law or regulatory requirements do not allow us to provide all of the information that we hold about you and/or such information may have already been destroyed, erased or made anonymous in accordance with our record retention obligations and practices.
          <br />
          <br />
          Pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.125, we are also forbidden from discriminating against you because of your exercise of a right under the California Consumer Privacy Act (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.100 et seq.) by denying your goods or services, by charging different prices or rates for goods or services, by providing a different level or quality of goods or services, or suggesting any of the foregoing.
