        <br />
        <Typography variant='body1'>
          YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT TABLE IS TO DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF THE SITE. TABLE, NOR ANY OF ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, SHAREHOLDERS, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION PROVIDERS, MERCHANTS, OR LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY,"TABLE PARTIES") SHALL BE LIABLE TO YOU OR THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND/OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, (EVEN IF TABLE OR THE APPLICABLE TABLE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW FOR: (A) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE TABLE OFFERINGS AND/OR ANY OTHER CONTENT, INFORMATION, PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES OFFERED BY AND THROUGH SAME; (B) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION, CONTENT AND/OR ANY OTHER PRODUCTS PURCHASED OR OBTAINED FROM OR THROUGH THE TABLE OFFERINGS; (C) THE UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, OR ALTERATION OF, YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION; (D) THE FAILURE TO REALIZE ANY SPECIFIC DIETARY BENEFIT, WEIGHT LOSS OR OTHER HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOME; AND/OR (E) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE TABLE OFFERINGS AND/OR ANY OTHER CONTENT, INFORMATION, PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES OFFERED BY AND/OR THROUGH SAME. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION, IN THE AGGREGATE INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, MISREPRESENTATION AND ANY AND ALL OTHER TORTS. YOU HEREBY RELEASE TABLE AND THE TABLE PARTIES FROM ANY AND ALL OBLIGATIONS, LIABILITIES AND CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF THE LIMITATIONS STATED HEREIN. IF APPLICABLE LAW DOES NOT PERMIT SUCH LIMITATIONS, THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF TABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY AND ALL CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE AS SET FORTH IN THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. NO ACTION, REGARDLESS OF FORM, ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE TABLE OFFERINGS AND/OR ANY OTHER PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES OFFERED BY AND/OR THROUGH SAME, MAY BE BROUGHT BY YOU OR TABLE MORE THAN ONE (1) YEAR FOLLOWING THE EVENT WHICH GAVE RISE TO THE SUBJECT CAUSE OF ACTION.

          Resolving Disputes — Arbitration
        </Typography>
        <br />
        <Typography variant='body1'>
          Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction BY emailing our customer service department at simon@tableweekly.com. IF Table's customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if Table has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.
          <br />
          <br/>
          All disputes or claims that arise under or related to this Agreement (whether in contract, tort or otherwise, whether past, pre-existing, or future, and including statutory, consumer protection, common law, intentional tort, injunctive, and equitable claims) will be resolved either in small claims court or by individual arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Unless you and Table agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
          <br />
          <br/>
          You agree to arbitration on an individual basis. In any dispute,   NEITHER CUSTOMER NOR TABLE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER CUSTOMERS, OR ARBITRATE OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIMS AS A REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER, OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced (but in no case shall there be a class arbitration).  
          <br />
          <br/>
          The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law. Any award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on each of the parties, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. This transaction and the arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA).

          Waiver and Severability
        </Typography>
        <br />
        <Typography variant='body1'>
          No waiver by Table of any of the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Table to assert a right or provision under these Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
          <br />
          <br/>
          If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

          Telephone Calls and SMS Text Messages
        </Typography>
        <br />
        <Typography variant='body1'>
          Upon registration for an account, you will be asked to provide us with a telephone number at which we can reach you. That number is required for shipping and so that Table can reach you with informational calls related to your transactions. The frequency of text messages that we send to you depends on your transactions with us and you consent to receive text messages sent through an automatic telephone dialing system. All calls to and from Table may be monitored or recorded for quality and training purposes.
          <br />
          <br/>
          If you elect to receive text messages about your account, we may also send you promotional text messages and you consent to receive recurring SMS text messages sent through an automatic telephone dialing system. This service is optional, and is not a condition of purchase. You can opt out of receiving SMS messages at any time by texting STOP in response. Message and data rates may apply. We will treat data collected through text messages in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
          <br />
          <br/>
          All charges are billed by and payable to your wireless service provider. Please contact your wireless service provider for pricing plans and details. If you wish to opt out of such text messages, you may do so by following the "opt-out" instructions in the text message, or by editing your account settings. Message and data rates may apply. We will treat data collected through text messages in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
