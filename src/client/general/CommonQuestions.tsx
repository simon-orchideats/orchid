                A subscription of weekly meal plans delivered from local restaurants. Each week, customers can either
                build their meal plan by picking meals from all different restaurants or allow Table to choose, based
                on their plan preferences.

                Each customer is then assigned a personal weekly server who will place and

                meals in one simple batch to the customer. Weekly deliveries are based on each customer's preferred
                schedule and confirmed in advance with exact ETA's.

              Table is a weekly subscription that delivers restaurant meals all at one low, flat rate with no extra
                fees. Our service offers unrivaled variety with the ability to mix and match different restaurants in
                each delivery. Imagine subscribing to Netflix vs buying 1 movie on Amazon.

                All restaurants on our listings are carefully picked and vetted to provide you the best food for your
                weekly meal plan. Furthermore, you are personally assigned a server that will deliver all your meals
                each week and text you far in advance of each delivery's ETA. No more trying to communicate and teach
                directions to a new stranger every time you get your food delivered. No more waiting around wondering
                when or if your food will arrive.
